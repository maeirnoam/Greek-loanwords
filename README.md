# Greek-loanwords

This repository contains the data for the study of Greek words in Syriac literature, entitled "Greek Words in Syriac Literature: A Computational-Quantitative Analysis of Syriac-Greek Literary Interactions", by Noam Maeir.

The full list of Greek words was extracted via the open API of Sedra. See: https://sedra.bethmardutho.org/about/openapi

The dataset of all the literary appearances of the Greek words was extracted from the Syriac literary database, Simtho's V.2. See: https://simtho.bethmardutho.org/#dashboard?corpname=simthoV2

During the work on the project Simtho's V.3 came online. As such, it would be beneficial to re-analyze the updated database, to examine the validity of the results based on V.2.
